sum "Gee, it sure is boring around here..."
sum "Is this the supposed peace all busy students should strive for?"
sum "I just wonder what the youkai are up to..."

sum "Oh!"
sum "That person..."
sum "She's one of the youkai who tried to stop me from entering Gensokyo, isn't she?"
sum "I wonder why she's here...?"

sum "Could it be!? The youkai had been infiltrating Earth this whole time!?"
sum "...Doesn't involve me, though. I can hold my own against them if I have to."
sum "I'll just say hi."

sum "Hiiiiii!"
mam "!"
mam "Uh, yes?"
sum "Don't act nonchalant! You can't fool me, Ms. tanuki!"
mam "..."
mam "Nothin' to be done about it."
mam "Couldja at least try to use my name, high-school girl?"
sum "I can't use what I don't have. And for the record, I-"
mam "Just a joke. Sumireko, isn't it?"
mam "Mamizou Futatsuiwa here. Pleasure to meetcha proper."
sum "I'm not sure I want to hear that from someone who tried to kill me..."
mam "Ah, hogwash. That's just danmaku play."
mam "You made it out in the end, anyway.
mam "Besides, you approached me today. Got something to say?"
sum "Hmm... not in particular. I just remembered you asked for a tour of the outside world during that incident, though."
sum "I've got the day off, and I'm way too awake to go to Gensokyo right now."
sum "Care to join me for a bit of modern entertainment?"

mam "I got this impression before, but..."
mam "You really are careless, aren'tcha?"
mam "I'll take that offer. I was just peeking around for a friend, anyway."
sum "Wonderful!"

mam "So, where are we going?"
sum "Let me check what's around on my phone."
mam "Can'tcha just look?"
sum "No, no..."
sum "Ah, this should do!"
sum "How does an arcade sound?"
mam "Never heard of 'em. Sounds great."

sum "Here we are, the arcade."
sum "A wonderful display of the degeneration of art this society seeks, the very epitome of meaningless and transient interactions, the place it would not be wrong to call-"
mam "Uh, do you even want to be here?"
sum "Well, it's fun sometimes."
mam "So, what are we doing?"
sum "To explain it to an ancient youkai..."
sum "Essentially, each of these unmanned stands hold a different game."
sum "Most of them are solitaire, but all of them have a competitive element."
sum "\"Do better than your friend\" and the like."
mam "'Zat so?"
mam "If danmaku's a game, you could say I'm pretty good at them."
sum "Oh, I think they have one like that here, too."
sum "I mean, not like it is in Gensokyo, but..."
sum "Whatever. Just follow me!"
sum "Best 2 out of 3 games wins!"



sum "So, what did you think?"
mam "Nothing like the real thing, but that's fine."
sum "You picked it up pretty easily. Have you played a video game before?"
mam "Not even once."
sum "Hm. Anyway, next up is a music game."
sum "We can play at the same time on this!"
sum "This might be a bit less intuitive for you, but it should make sense."


sum "You aren't bad at all."
sum "I wonder how much of that is just because of your biology, though."
mam "Don't worry about that."
mam "By the way, what does the winner get?"
mam "Of your \"2 out of 3\"?"
sum "I said that, but..."
sum "Then I remembered the last bet we had.'
sum "Just so you know, I won't accept anything from a tanuki anymore, even if I win."
mam "Ah, what a frightened human. A sight for sore eyes."
sum "But if you win-"
mam "Nah."
sum "Nah?"
mam "Meaningless games are fine by me. Nothing you could give me that I couldn't get myself, anyway."
sum "Very well."
sum "The next game is a..."
sum "Wait, do you know what a car is?"
mam "Wheels, metal, moves. That about right?"
sum "That's probably enough. The game is a race using cars."
sum "Now that I've flown, they kind of seem useless, though."
mam "Humans shouldn't get too used to leaving the ground. Eventually, you won't be able to know it again until your death."
sum "What is that supposed to be about, Icarus? I know my limits."
mam "Then on with the games."



mam "Ah, what fun."
mam "I ought to be going now."
sum "I suppose so."
sum "How did you like them? The games you can play by pretending to be a human."
mam "Nothing special, nothing bad. Humans are talented at making trinkets."
mam "I much prefer the game you choose to play while pretending to be a youkai."
sum "Of course. Imitation magic in pixels can't match the real thing."
sum "Good night, Ms. tanuki."
mam "Seeya, kid-"
mam "Wait, that's not..."
mam "Ah, whatever."
