sum confused on left, facing right
sum "Gee, it sure is boring around here..."
sum "Is this the supposed peace all busy students should strive for?"
sum smug2
sum "I just wonder what the youkai are up to..."

sum surprised
sum "Oh!"
mam neutral appears on right, facing right
sum "That person..."
sum "She's one of the youkai who tried to stop me from entering Gensokyo, isn't she?"
sum confused
sum "I wonder why she's here...?"

sum surprised
sum "Could it be!? The youkai had been infiltrating Earth this whole time!?"
sum smug2
sum "...Doesn't involve me, though. I can hold my own against them if I have to."
sum smug
sum "I'll just say hi."

sum happy moves toward center
sum "Hiiiiii!"
mam mild faces left
mam "!"
mam smug
mam "Uh, yes?"
sum smug2
sum "Don't act nonchalant! You can't fool me, Ms. tanuki!"
mam "..."
sum moves center-left, mam moves center-right (reposition with same distance between the two so they are at a more natural position on the screen)
mam sans
mam "Nothin' to be done about it."
mam "Couldja at least try to use my name, high-school girl?"
sum confused
sum "I can't use what I don't have. And for the record, I-"
mam smug
mam "Just a joke. Sumireko, isn't it?"
mam "Mamizou Futatsuiwa here. Pleasure to meetcha proper."
sum disappointed
sum "I'm not sure I want to hear that from someone who tried to kill me..."
mam smug
mam "Ah, hogwash. That's just danmaku play."
mam sans
mam "Made it out in the end anyway, didn'tcha?"
mam neutral
mam "But you approached me today. Got something to say?"
sum happy
sum "Hmm... not in particular. I just remembered you asked for a tour of the outside world during that incident, though."
sum "I've got the day off, and I'm way too awake to go to Gensokyo right now."
sum smug
sum "Care to join me for a bit of modern entertainment?"

mam "I got this impression before, but..."
mam "You really are careless, aren'tcha?"
mam smug
mam "I'll take that offer. I was just peeking around for a friend, anyway."
sum smug2
sum "Wonderful!"

mam neutral
mam "So, where are we going?"
sum confused
sum "Let me check what's around on my phone."
mam confused
mam "Can'tcha just look?"
sum "No, no..."
sum happy
sum "Ah, this should do!"
sum "How does an arcade sound?"
mam smug
mam "Never heard of 'em. Sounds great."

sum smug
sum "Here we are, the arcade."
sum smug2
sum "A wonderful display of the degeneration of art this society seeks, the very epitome of meaningless and transient interactions, the place it would not be wrong to call-"
mam confused
mam "Uh, do you even want to be here?"
sum happy
sum "Well, it's fun sometimes."

mam neutral
mam "What do we do here?"
sum confused
sum "To explain it to an ancient youkai..."
sum happy
sum "Essentially, each of these unmanned stands hold a different game."
sum "Most of them are solitaire, but all of them have a competitive element."
sum "\"Do better than your friend\" and the like."
mam mild
mam "'Zat so?"
mam smug2
mam "If danmaku's a game, you could say I'm pretty good at them."
sum surprised
sum "Oh, I think they have one like that here, too."
sum confused
sum "I mean, not like it is in Gensokyo, but..."
sum smug
sum "Whatever. Just follow me!"
sum "Best 2 out of 3 games wins!"

[play danmaku]

sum happy
sum "So, what did you think?"
mam smug
mam "Nothing like the real thing, but that's fine."
sum surprised
sum "You picked it up pretty easily. Have you played a video game before?"
mam smug2
mam "Not even once."
sum confused
sum "Hm. Anyway, next up is a music game."
sum happy
sum "We can play at the same time on this!"
sum "This might be a bit less intuitive for you, but it should make sense."

sum smug
sum "You aren't bad at all."
sum "I wonder how much of that is just because of your biology, though."
mam smug
mam "Don't worry about that."
mam neutral
mam "By the way, what does the winner get?"
mam "Of your \"2 out of 3\"?"
sum confused
sum "I said that, but..."
sum "Then I remembered the last bet we had."
sum disappointed
sum "Just so you know, I won't accept anything from a tanuki anymore, even if I win."
mam smug2
mam "Ah, what a frightened human. A sight for sore eyes."
sum happy
sum "But if you win-"
mam sans
mam "Nah."
sum surprised
sum "Nah?"
mam neutral
mam "Meaningless games are fine by me. Nothing you could give me that I couldn't get myself, anyway."
sum smug
sum "Very well."
sum "The next game is a..."
sum confused
sum "Wait, do you know what a car is?"
mam "Wheels, metal, moves. That about right?"
sum "That's probably enough. The game is a race using cars."
sum smug2
sum "Now that I've flown, they kind of seem useless, though. Cars, that is."
mam smug2
mam "Humans shouldn't get too used to leaving the ground. Eventually, you won't be able to know it again until your death."
sum confused
sum "What is that supposed to be about, Icarus? I know my limits."
mam sans
mam "Then on with the games."

[play racism]

mam smug
mam "Ah, what fun."
mam neutral
mam "I ought to be going now."
sum smug
sum "I suppose so."
sum happy
sum "How did you like them? The games you can play by pretending to be a human."
mam smug
mam "Nothing special, nothing bad. Humans are talented at making trinkets."
mam "I much prefer the game you choose to play while pretending to be a youkai."
sum smug2
sum "Of course. Imitation magic in pixels can't match the real thing."
sum happy
sum "Good day, Ms. tanuki."
sum leaves on left
mam neutral
mam "Seeya, kid-"
mam confused
mam "Wait, that's not..."
mam sans
mam "Ah, whatever."
