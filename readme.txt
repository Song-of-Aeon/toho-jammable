hello hello thanks for downloading rate 5 and all that but more importantly: listen up about whats going on with this game
it includes a whole one two three FOUR gameplay styles because ???
anyway here are the controls for each:

vn-like segment:
space/enter/z/s: advance text
control: skip

danmaku-like segment:
arrows: move
shift: focus
z: shoot (rock)
x: shoot (paper)
c: shoot (scissors)

rhythm-like segment:
arrows/askl/wasd/numpad: hit notes

car-like segment:
up: accelerate
left/right: turn
down: reverse
shift: drift


so what's going on, huh? why all the stuff?
"combo".
normally i start with the story and work to the gameplay for jams. can't pull nearly as much out of "combo" as some of the past themes so it was like "combo = gaming = they are gaming". since they are gaming, have to be playing games. then we made three of them.
about each of them:

danmaku game is rock-paper-scissors themed. tried to make it so certain shot types are more effective against certain patterns. rock (z) is good against the first one (scissors) for example since it's consistent forward damage. scissors (x) is good against the third (paper) because it's easier to get close to the boss.
it's called "JANKEN 2".

rhythm game is, code-wise, a good amount lifted from another ddr clone i made (play espeon78.itch.io/amortality free forever) but of course, the music and map is original. as is the noteskin. if this is the post-jam version, you might see those packaged alongside the game if you want to play the map in stepmania. it's pretty easy if you know what you're doing, but i'm not sure if it's possible for everyone. good thing it barely matters if you win or lose.
it's called "i can't believe it's not DDR!".

racing game? i don't know, it's exactly what it looks like. go fast.
made to look like old sega racing games. i've never played an old sega racing game.
it's called "ULTIMATE CALIFORNIA DRIVER 1946". from what i understand, massive torii are common in california.

by the way, an option called "Partial" appears once you beat the game once. unfortunately, the game doesn't save so you can't access this without beating the game every time you open it. i'm not going to make it save, so you can just press "P" on the main menu to access it without any restrictions. do try to beat the game normally first, though.
